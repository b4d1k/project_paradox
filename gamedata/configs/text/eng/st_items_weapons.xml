	<string id="st_wpn_abakan_descr">
		<text>A modern assault rifle developed as a replacement for the ageing AK-74. The main difference is its high speed 2-round burst firing mode, which allows two bullets to be fired at exactly the same spot on a target up to 100 meters away. This significantly increases the likelihood of hitting the target in comparison to the 1 round firing mode, which considerably improves kill potential, stopping power and armor piercing capability.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_ak74_descr">
		<text>This weapon, designed in 1974, signaled the adoption of small caliber and low impulse rounds by Warsaw Pact countries. A descendant of the most popular assault rifle in the world, the AK-74 has a bigger muzzle brake, resulting in a reduction of what was already manageable recoil. This facilitates better accuracy and groupings, especially when fired in fast single shots or bursts. As before, the rifle is very simple and reliable.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_ak74u_descr">
		<text>Despite being similar to submachine guns in size, weight and tactical purpose, this weapon is classified as an assault rifle due to its use of the same intermediate cartridge as its larger cousin the AK-74. The weapon is notable for its mobility in close quarters and high armor-penetration capacity, while its drawbacks are its short effective range, despite the relatively long bullet range, a tendency to overheat and high ricochet propensity.</text>

		<text>An improved version of a classic automatic pistol, which passed all the major armed conflicts of the 20th century with flying colors and entered the new millennium with confidence. Produced by dozens if not hundreds of arms manufacturers around the world in both standard and modified configurations. The weapon’s only drawback, its mediocre magazine capacity, is largely compensated for by the hard-hitting ammo it uses.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_eagle_descr">
		<text>The ultimate hand cannon - bulky, heavy, impractical - yet highly lethal. Developed as a specialized weapon for hunting medium-sized and large game, as well as for shooting competitions involving firing at steel body targets at distances over 50 meters. Its limited use in the Zone can be attributed to its price, size and weight, which are all double those of other pistols.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_fn2000_descr">
		<text>This Austrian bullpup 5.56mm assault rifle was adopted by the Austrian Army in 1978, where it replaced the 7.62mm StG 58 automatic rifle (better known as FN FAL). It uses a 1.5x telescopic sight that doubles as a carrying handle. Incredibly versatile, lightweight and cost-effective, the AUG is still in use today in many of the world’s armed forces.</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_fn2000_nimble_descr">
		<text>This futuristic-looking weapon with a bullpup layout is actually a mass produced modular system, comprising a rifle & grenade complex with a computerized fire control system and a 40mm grenade launcher.

	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_fort_descr">
		<text>A Ukrainian-made pistol predominantly used by law enforcement organizations. Provides higher accuracy, better ergonomics and has a larger magazine than the PM.  These pistols make it into the Zone in large numbers thanks to the sale of defective weapons, which suffer from technical miscalculations in early design models. Despite this, the pistol is in demand among stalkers thanks to its good combat characteristics.</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_g36_descr">
		<text>A new addition to the Western-made assault rifle family, which differs significantly from previous models in the series built on an automatic foundation with a semi-open bolt assembly, this weapon is more like American automatic gas-operated assault rifles with a short-stroke gas piston system. These changes ensure that the rifle is a first-rate example of a modern weapon - lightweight, reliable and ergonomic.</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_g36_nimble_descr">
		<text>The XM8 Lightweight Carbine was intended to replace existing M4 carbine in the US Army arsenal and reduce the 21st century soldier's load and increase his mobility. It is a derivative of the Heckler and Koch G36 assault rifle, and is similar to that rifle in design and functioning.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_l85_descr">
		<text>This rifle’s considerable number of drawbacks caused most of these weapons to be modernized, with the retired stock making its way to the Zone via the black market. The rifle's main advantages are its built-in 4x scope, high single-shot accuracy and reliable upgrade technology. When the weapon is fired in bursts, its accuracy decreases significantly and the rifle's basic internal mechanisms become somewhat unreliable.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_lr300_descr">
		<text>A new step in the development of this famous weapon family. The changes were made to the upper half of the steel construction comprising the barrel, gas tube and bolt assembly, reducing the weapon’s weight, improving ergonomics and its gas system. The weapon is highly accurate, although its propensity to catch dirt makes it a poor choice for the Zone’s difficult conditions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_pb_descr">
		<text>This pistol was developed in the second half of the 20th century on the basis of the PMm for use by special forces and scouting units. The front of the pistol’s barrel is covered with an integrated silencer, while the bolt mechanism is short, which prevents a back-moving spring from being located inside it, and it is therefore situated in the weapon’s handle. Though obsolete, the weapon is still effective in the right hands.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_pm_descr">
		<text>This Soviet legacy is the most common pistol in the Zone. It is small, highly reliable, easy to use and maintain in working order.

	<string id="st_wpn_protecta_descr">
		<text>A smoothbore combat revolver-type shotgun intended to provide extreme firepower for militarized units.

	<string id="st_wpn_svu_descr">
		<text>A modernized version of the SVD sniper rifle in a compact bullpup design made on the order of rapid response forces.

	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_val_descr">
		<text>The assault rifle cousin of the Vintorez sniper rifle, this rifle was designed as a special forces weapon.
